#
# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A DASHBOARD CHECKLIST
#
# Half of these settings are load-bearing for this specific app and three of them
# will break it outright if someone turns them on later "because they sound like
# performance". A script says which and why, lives in the repo, and can be re-run
# after any dashboard fiddling to put the zone back. It is idempotent: every call
# is a PATCH to a desired state, so running it twice changes nothing the second
# time.
#
# USAGE
#
#   scripts/cloudflare-setup.sh                 # dry run, prints what would change
#   scripts/cloudflare-setup.sh --apply         # actually writes
#
# Needs a token that the D1 token in .env is NOT: create one at
# dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens with
#   Zone / Zone Settings / Edit
#   Zone / Cache Rules  / Edit      (only for the cache-rule section)
#   Zone / Zone         / Read
# scoped to this one zone, then:
#
#   export CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN=...
#   export CF_ZONE=soncollection.com     # or CF_ZONE_ID=...
#
# Settings the free plan does not include are reported as unavailable and
# skipped rather than failing the run — that is the point of reporting each
# call's own answer instead of assuming a plan tier.

No zone-capable credential in the environment. Set either:

  export CF_ZONE_API_TOKEN=...                       # scoped token (preferred)

or, for the legacy Global API Key:

  export CF_API_EMAIL=you@example.com
  export CF_GLOBAL_API_KEY=...

CF_D1_API_TOKEN from .env will not work — it is scoped to D1 and lists no zones.

cat <<'NOTE'

Two things this script deliberately does not turn on
---------------------------------------------------

Bot Fight Mode (free) injects a JS challenge into responses to clients it judges
automated. Discord, Slack, Twitter and Google's unfurlers ARE automated clients,
and unfurling is the product: this whole app is SsrMode::Async specifically so
that og: tags reach them in the first response. Enabling it trades link previews
for bot noise. Leave it off, and if scraping ever becomes a real cost, rate-limit
/api/* by path instead.

Hotlink Protection, for the same class of reason: /embed/:id and /oembed exist so
other sites can embed a son, and media.soncollection.com is a public image host
by design.

Cache Rules worth adding by hand (free plan allows 10)
------------------------------------------------------

The origin headers already do the right thing, so these are belt-and-braces
rather than load-bearing — add them only if you want the edge to enforce it
independently of the app:

  1. Bypass cache   when  URI Path starts with  /api/ or /auth/ or /admin
  2. Bypass cache   when  URI Path ends with    /download
  3. Eligible for cache, Edge TTL "respect origin", when URI Path starts with /pkg/

Do NOT add a rule that caches "/" or "/son/*" at the edge. Those responses embed
per-visitor state — whether you have cried over a son, and your account menu — so
an edge-cached copy serves one visitor's session to the next.
