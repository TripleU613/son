# Build the production image before pushing, on a host that actually has Docker.
#
# Why this exists: this dev machine has no container runtime and no sudo to install
# one, so `RUN` steps in the Dockerfile were only ever exercised by CI. Three
# consecutive CI failures came from that blind spot -- a base digest that did not
# resolve, then `awscli` having no installation candidate on the Playwright base --
# each costing ~12 minutes to learn something a build says in two.
#
# bulky-server has Docker and is reachable over Tailscale SSH, so the context is
# piped to it and built there. Nothing is pushed or tagged into the deploy.
#
#   scripts/build-check.sh              # build only
#   scripts/build-check.sh --run        # build, then start it and check all four
#                                       # processes actually come up
#   scripts/build-check.sh --audit      # build, then scan its layers for secrets
#
# One image since the merge (app + Gemini sidecar + session keeper + cloudflared),
# so there is one build to check rather than three -- but it now includes a ~1.9GB
# browser base, which is why this is still not in the pre-push hook: pulling that
# is the wrong tax on every push. Run it when the Dockerfile, a requirements file,
# supervisord.conf or the keeper's entrypoint changes.
