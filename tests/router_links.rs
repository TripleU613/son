//! Every `<a>` pointing at an Axum route must opt out of the client-side router.
//!
//! `leptos_router` intercepts same-origin anchor clicks and resolves them against
//! its own route table unless the anchor carries `download` or `rel="external"`
//! (`leptos_router`'s `location/mod.rs`). The Axum routes in `main.rs` are not in
//! that table, so an intercepted click matches nothing and renders the 404 page.
//! The endpoint is fine; the button looks broken. It is invisible in code review,
//! compiles cleanly, and only shows up as "there are just too many 404s for no
//! reason" -- which is how it was actually reported, after it had happened to the
//! sign-in link, the download button, and the admin browser link.
//!
//! So the invariant is checked rather than remembered. The route list is parsed out
//! of `main.rs` instead of being copied here, which means a newly added Axum route
//! is covered by this test the moment it is registered -- the failure mode of a
//! hardcoded list is that it silently stops covering the thing you just added.
//!
//! This reads source text, which is unusual for a test and worth being honest
//! about: it can only see anchors whose href contains a literal. That is every one
//! of them today. An href built entirely at runtime would pass unexamined, and the
//! structural guard for that case is `components::sign_in::SignInLink` -- one
//! component that owns the attribute for the one link that was built that way.
