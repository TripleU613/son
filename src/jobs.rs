//! Upload progress, tracked per job so the page can show what is happening.
//!
//! An upload takes the best part of a minute, nearly all of it Gemini generating
//! an image. A form that just hangs for that long looks broken, so the POST
//! returns a job id straight away and the browser polls this registry for the
//! step it is on.
//!
//! In memory, deliberately. There is exactly one app process and "no storage on
//! the server" is a hard rule, so a table or a Redis would both be wrong here.
//! The cost is that a restart loses in-flight jobs: the browser sees the id go
//! missing and says so, rather than waiting forever on a job nobody is running.
