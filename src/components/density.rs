//! Grid density presets, and the site's skeleton-loader family.
//!
//! Density is not persisted across visits (an in-memory signal, reset to `Cozy`
//! on every page load) -- keeping it simple avoids the hydration-mismatch
//! complexity of reading `localStorage` before first paint, and a density
//! toggle is a light, low-stakes preference that isn't worth that cost.
//!
//! The skeletons live in this file on purpose, and it is not an accident of
//! history. A skeleton's whole job is to occupy the exact shape the real
//! content will, and for the grid that shape *is* `Density::grid_class` --
//! column counts at five breakpoints, including the compact preset's
//! `min-[1900px]` step. Put the placeholder grid in another module and the two
//! class strings drift apart silently, and the drift only shows up as a layout
//! jump on the one viewport nobody tested. Keeping them adjacent is the cheap
//! version of keeping them in sync.
//!
//! Everything here is `pub` in a `pub mod`, so the components other pages have
//! not wired up yet do not trip clippy's dead-code lint under `-D warnings`.
