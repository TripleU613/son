//! Two controls for two different actions: send this son to a person, and put
//! this son on a page.
//!
//! The share control is one button, not two. On a phone `navigator.share`
//! opens the real share sheet (Messages, WhatsApp, AirDrop), which is what
//! someone actually wants when they find a son worth sending. On a desktop
//! browser that API is mostly absent, so the same button writes the URL to the
//! clipboard instead. Offering both side by side would put a dead button in
//! front of half the visitors, and its label and icon follow the capability
//! rather than the viewport because that is what the button will really do --
//! deciding by CSS breakpoint would promise a share sheet to a narrow desktop
//! window that has no such thing.
//!
//! `EmbedButton` is a second control on the same row and that is not a
//! contradiction of the above. It is not a capability-dependent duplicate of
//! sharing; it copies the `<iframe>` markup for `/embed/:slug`, which is a
//! different thing to hand someone. It is always live -- there is no browser
//! where it does nothing -- so the "never show a dead button" rule that keeps
//! share at one control is what allows this one to exist at all.
