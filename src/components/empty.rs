//! One empty/zero-result state, shared by the gallery, search and leaderboard.
//!
//! Deliberately rigid: icon, one line, at most one action. Every page that
//! previously wrote its own empty state grew a subtitle and an explanatory
//! sentence ("The collection is empty. Be the first father.", "Ranked by public
//! sons uploaded while signed in. Anonymous uploads don't count toward this…"),
//! which is exactly the narration the redesign has a copy budget against. A
//! component with nowhere to put a paragraph is the enforcement mechanism.
