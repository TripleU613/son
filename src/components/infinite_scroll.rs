//! A near-invisible sentinel placed after the grid. Once it comes within
//! `PREFETCH_MARGIN` of the viewport, `on_visible` fires and the next page is
//! fetched. There is no longer a button beside it -- the sentinel is the whole
//! mechanism.
//!
//! The margin is the part that matters. With the observer's default options the
//! sentinel only counts as visible once it is genuinely on screen, so a visitor
//! scrolls to the bottom of the grid and *then* waits out a round trip, once per
//! page, forever. Firing a screenful early means the next page has usually
//! already landed by the time they reach it.
