            // `.field` is a form control: bordered, on `bg-surface`, sized to sit
            // in a column of other inputs. In the top bar that made the loudest,
            // brightest box on a phone screen a search field on a gallery with
            // three items in it -- 57% of the bar's width, taller than the logo,
            // and the first thing the eye landed on. This is the same control
            // written as a quiet pill instead: no border, one step off the
            // background, 36px tall.
            //
            // Written as utilities rather than as overrides on top of `.field`,
            // because border, background and radius would then be set twice at
            // equal specificity and settle on stylesheet order -- the exact
            // coin-flip this project deleted its stylesheet to be rid of.
            // `.field` itself is untouched; the upload, report and admin forms
            // still use it and still want the bordered form-control look.
