//! The gallery's sort control, and the shared state behind it.
//!
//! "Son of the day" is an option here rather than a `Sort` variant. It is not an
//! ordering -- it selects a single featured son from a different query
//! (`db::son_of_the_day`) -- so folding it into `Sort` would have meant a fake
//! ordering in the enum, the wire format and the SQL. `GalleryView` keeps that
//! distinction in the UI layer, where it belongs, and leaves `Sort` untouched.
//!
//! The four options used to be four pills, every one of them on screen at all
//! times. That row owned the full width of a phone, stopped fitting somewhere
//! around 360px and scrolled sideways from there -- directly beneath a 56px bar,
//! so two bands of chrome ate the top of the viewport before a single son
//! appeared. It is one button now: it names the current ordering and expands to
//! the four choices on demand. What that costs is discovery -- nobody finds "Son
//! of the day" without opening the menu -- which is exactly why the menu spells
//! every option out in full rather than keeping the abbreviations the strip
//! needed to fit.
//!
//! The file name lags the component on purpose: `SortMenu` lives in
//! `sort_chips.rs` because renaming the module would mean edits to `mod.rs` and
//! `app.rs` for no behaviour change at all.
